### Description

This program simulates fire. I have seen other articles that simulate fire, but this one is extremely fast (95-102 FPS on my 366) and it uses some neat API calls that most programmers probably have never seen before. I uploaded this before, but it only worked if your computer was in 24-bit colormode. I have changed it so that anyone running in 16, 24, or 32-bit colormode can see the fire perfectly. I really want to know what you think of my program. I have commented it heavily so even a beginner should be able to understand what each line does. I really hope that you will vote and leave comments, I have worked really hard to make this compatible and also the get such a high FPS so please let me know what you think.
